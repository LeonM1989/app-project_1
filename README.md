// 3. Getting help

you can go through the module without mistakes...
this will be great!
but in any case, if you get error/stuck:
-- solve yourself first: --

try to understand what you are doing (this could be enough)
read the error (this could be enough)
search the error on google/so and learn from other's experience - you'r not so special or first (this could be enough) -- get personal help: --
ask classmates (this could be enough)
you can ask me for the code and see if it works on your computer, investigate from there
tips:

check the basics (typos, start server, wrong url... etc);
help others if they ask (in a way they will benefit from it)
